# Business Problem:
The finance team needs to segment prospective users (level). This classification will be used to determine deposit/withdrawal limits. How would you build a model and how would you producitonize it?

## Submissions:
* A pickled model file
* The code used to generate the model
* Production design summary
    * please demonstrate your thought thought process for how you would put this into production/why you made these design decision, i.e.
        * how would you implement this in a cloud (AWS or GCP) architecture?
        * which IaaS/PaaS components would you use?
        * why would you use these?
        * how would you monitor this service in production to accommodate for reliability?
        * what business considerations might impact your design decisions?
        * etc.

## How you will be evaluated:
* We will evaluate your work based on code quality, problem-solving, workflow, analytical rigor, and ability to communicate your work

## Additional Notes:

* At Gemini. we prefer python/jupter for analysis, but if you feel more comfortable using another tool/language, please feel free
* This is an open-ended question, so we are not looking for 100% accuracy out of your model. We're looking for you to show off your thought process, and have fun coding!
